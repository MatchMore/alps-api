    ## MATCHMORE
    The first version of the MATCHMORE API is an exciting step to allow
    developers use a context-aware pub/sub cloud service.  A lot of mobile
    applications and their use cases may be modeled using this approach and can
    therefore profit form using MATCHMORE as their backend service.
    **Build something great with MATCHMORE!**
    Once you've [registered your
    client](https://dev.matchmore.io/account/register/) it's easy start using our
    awesome cloud based context-aware pub/sub (admitted, a lot of buzzwords).

    ## RESTful API
    We do our best to have all our URLs be
    [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).
    Every endpoint (URL) may support one of four different http verbs. GET
    requests fetch information about an object, POST requests create objects,
    PUT requests update objects, and finally DELETE requests will delete
    objects.

    ## Domain model

    ### User

    ### Device

    ### Location

    ### Publication

    ### Subscription

    ### Match
