    ## ALPS by [MATCHMORE](http://matchmore.io)

    The first version of the MATCHMORE API is an exciting step to
    allow developers use a context-aware pub/sub cloud service.  A lot
    of mobile applications and their use cases may be modeled using
    this approach and can therefore profit from using MATCHMORE as
    their backend service.

    **Build something great with [ALPS by MATCHMORE](http://matchmore.io)!**


    Once you've [registered your
    client](http://matchmore.io/account/register/) it's easy
    start using our awesome cloud based context-aware pub/sub
    (admitted, a lot of buzzwords).

    ## RESTful API
    We do our best to have all our URLs be
    [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).
    Every endpoint (URL) may support one of four different http verbs. GET
    requests fetch information about an object, POST requests create objects,
    PUT requests update objects, and finally DELETE requests will delete
    objects.

    ## Domain Model

    This is the current domain model extended by an ontology of devices
    and separation between the developer portal and the ALPS Core.

    1.  A **developer** is a mobile application developer registered in the
        developer portal and allowed to use the **ALPS Developer Portal**.  A
        developer might register one or more **applications** to use the
        **ALPS Core cloud service**.  For developer/application pair a new
        **world** is created in the **ALPS Core** and assigned an **API key** to
        enable access to the ALPS Core cloud service **RESTful API**.  During
        the registration, the developer needs to provide additional
        configuration information for each application, e.g. its default
        **push endpoint** URI for match delivery, etc.
    2.  A [**user**](#tag/user) represents an *anonymous* user of the ALPS Core cloud
        service.  He/she can be connected via its mobile device or a user
        can be just an owner of Pin- or iBeacon devices.  A user issues
        **publications** and **subscriptions** for one of his associated
        **devices**, i.e. the publications and subscriptions *belong* to the
        particular device.
    3.  A [**device**](#tag/device) might be either *virtual* like a **pin device** or
        *physical* like a **mobile device** or **iBeacon device**.  A [**pin
        device**](#tag/device) is one that has geographical [**location**](#tag/location) associated with it
        but is not represented by any object in the physical world; usually
        it's location doesn't change frequently if at all.  A [**mobile
        device**](#tag/device) is one that potentially moves together with its user and
        therefore has a geographical location associated with it.  A mobile
        device is typically a location-aware smartphone, which knows its
        location thanks to GPS or to some other means like cell tower
        triangulation, etc.  An [**iBeacon device**](#tag/device) represents an Apple
        conform [iBeacon](https://developer.apple.com/ibeacon/) announcing its presence via Bluetooth LE
        advertising packets which can be detected by a other mobile device.
        It doesn't necessary has any location associated with it but it
        serves to detect and announce its proximity to other **mobile
        devices**.
    4.  The hardware and software stack running on a given device is known
        as its **platform**.  This include its hardware-related capabilities,
        its operating systems, as well as the set of libraries (APIs)
        offered to developers in order to program it.
    5.  A user may issue publications and subscriptions on his/her devices
        at **any time**; it may also cancel publications and subscriptions
        issued previously.  **Publications** and **subscriptions** do have a
        definable, finite duration, after which they are deleted from the
        ALPS Core cloud service and don't participate anymore in the
        matching process.
    6.  A [**publication**](#tag/publication) is similar to a Java Messaging Service (JMS)
        publication extended with the notion of a **geographical zone**.  The
        zone is defined as **circle** with a center at the given location and
        a range around that location.
    7.  A [**subscription**](#tag/subscription) is similar to a JMS subscription extended with the
        notion of **geographical zone**. Again, the zone being defined as
        **circle** with a center at the given location and a range around
        that location.
    8.  **Publications** and **subscriptions** which are associated with a
        **mobile device**, e.g. user's mobile phone, potentially **follow the
        movements** of the user carrying the device and therefore change
        their associated location.
    9.  A [**match**](#tag/match) between a publication and a subscription occurs when both
        of the following two conditions hold:
        1.  There is a **context match** occurs when for instance the
            subscription zone overlaps with the publication zone or a
            **proximity event** with an iBeacon device within the defined
            range occurred.
        2.  There is a **content match**: the publication and the subscription
            match with respect to their JMS counterparts, i.e., they were
            issued on the same topic and have compatible properties and the
            evaluation of the selector against those properties returns true
            value.
    10. A **push notification** is an asynchronous mechanism that allows a
        user to receive matches for a subscription on his/her device.
        Such a mechanism is clearly dependent on the deviceâ€™s platform and
        capabilities.  In order to use push notifications, a user must
        first register a device (and possibly an application on that
        device) with the ALPS core cloud service.
    11. Whenever a **match** between a publication and a subscription
        occurs, the device which owns the subscription receives that match
        *asynchronously* via a push notification if there exists a
        registered **push endpoint**.  A **push endpoint** is an URI which is
        able to consume the matches for a particular device and
        subscription.  The **push endpoint** doesn't necessary point to a
        **mobile device** but is rather a very flexible mechanism to define
        where the matches should be delivered.
    12. Matches can also be retrieved by issuing a API call for a
        particular device.
